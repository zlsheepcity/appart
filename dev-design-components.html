    <h2>Customisation Options</h2>
    <div>
        <p>The Self-Service sportsbook solution allows clients to implement their own website design. However, there are many other customisation options available with the Self-Service solution, such as the possibility to customise the front-end, widgets, and change the colour scheme. In addition, all other additional functionalities can also be customised and implemented by clients’ developers.</p>

        <p>Finally, operators will be able to rearrange blocks on a page freely and will be able to position custom-designed banners on their website. A few additional perks include full access to geolocation technologies, custom odds and lines, automatic live events configuration, as well as a cash-out option with an adjustable commission.</p>
